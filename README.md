### Google is trying to kill the Open Web

Using the proposed “Web Environment Integrity” means websites can select on which devices (browsers) they wish to be displayed, and can refuse service to other devices. It binds client side software to a website, creating a silo’d app.

This penalizes platforms on which the preferred client side software is not available.

This is an issue for accessibility and inclusion, in particular when the reason the software is not available is tied to the needs of marginalized groups, such as when poverty makes it impossible to own sufficiently modern devices, etc.

“Web Environment Integrity” is a deeply #antisocial proposal, and goes counter to the design principles of the web.

In all honesty, this move by Google is hardly surprising. They’ve been trying to capture the web as their own platform for a long time. This is just the latest battle.

But it also marks a particularly perverse point, in how the proposal admits it exists primarily to extract value from people. People mining at its worst.

Remember when their motto was “Don’t be Evil?”
